# Wiki
A simple creation of a wikipedia website. The website gives users the ability to add, edit and view different articles. The home page consists of a list of links to all the pages available within the site. The search feature allows for quick lookup and access to articles, and the fun "random page" button on the side panel allows for the retrieval of a random page for readers looking to past time.
